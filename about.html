    <div class="aboutMe">
        <p>
            I am currently a Senior at the University of Oklahoma pursuing a degree in Accounting and Management Information Systems.
            I decided to pursue a career in business because it is the language of the world. Accounting allows me to identify patterns and understand the different systems in a business.
            MIS on the other hand, allows me a more technical viewpoint through the use of databases and other technological systems. I have had the privilege of completing several technical courses 
            that have allowed me to become familiar with a wide range of skills. The cirtical thinking skills from Accounting and my knowledge of technology allowed me to successfully complete an internship
            at Protiviti Consulting. I have accepted a full time position with them and look forward expanding my knowledge.
