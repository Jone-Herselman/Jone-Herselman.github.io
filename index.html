                This website is a tangible resume that accurately shows my accomplishments while highlighting my technological knowledge and skill set.
                Through building my website, I have improved on my skills while also allowing my personality to show in a way that a resume cannot reflect.
                The purpose of this website is to give the world a glimpse into who I am and who I aspire to be one day.
